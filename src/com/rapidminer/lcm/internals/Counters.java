 * projected dataset.
 * 
 * We're using arrays as Maps<Int,Int> , however they're not public as item
 * identifiers may have been renamed by dataset representation. By the way this
 * class is able to generate renamings (and applies them to itself by the way)
 * if you need to rename items in a future representation. You *MUST* handle
 * renaming after instantiation. See field reverseRenaming.
